## Overview

A Python-based parser for viral genome sequences downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database.

This tool extracts:

- Accession number
- Organism name
- 5' UTR sequence
- Complete Coding Sequence (CDS)
- Mature peptides (mat_peptide features)
- Full translated proteome
- 3' UTR sequence

The extracted information is exported as a structured CSV file for downstream bioinformatics workflows.
